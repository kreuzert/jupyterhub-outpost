# Configuration

JupyterHub Outpost configuration is nearly the same as the JupyterHub Spawner configuration.
The easiest way is to write the configuration in the key `outpostConfig` in the `values.yaml` file.
  
## Simple KubeSpawner

In this example all single-user servers will be started with the same image. The JupyterHub OutpostSpawner can override each `c.<Spawner>.<key>` value, using the `custom_misc` feature. For more information look into the [OutpostSpawner](https://jupyterhub-outpostspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) configuration.
```
cat <<EOF >> values.yaml
...
outpostConfig: |
  from kubespawner import KubeSpawner
  c.JupyterHubOutpost.spawner_class = KubeSpawner
  c.KubeSpawner.image = "jupyter/minimal-notebook:notebook-7.0.3"
EOF

helm upgrade --install -f values.yaml --namespace outpost outpost jupyterhub-outpost/jupyterhub-outpost
```

## Customize Logging
For the logging configuration the Outpost offers these options (all used the same as for JupyterHub):
```
c.JupyterHubOutpost.log_level = ...
c.JupyterHubOutpost.log_datafmt = ...
c.JupyterHubOutpost.log_format = ...
```

If more customization is required, one can do this directly in the configuration itself.
```
class TornadoGeneralLoggingFilter(logging.Filter):
  def filter(self, record):
    # I don't want to see this log line generated by tornado
    if str(record.msg).startswith("Could not open static file"):
      return False
    return True

logging.getLogger("tornado.general").addFilter(TornadoGeneralLoggingFilter())

import os
logged_logger_name = os.environ.get("LOGGER_NAME", "MyOutpostInstance")
c.JupyterHubOutpost.log_format = f"%(color)s[%(levelname)1.1s %(asctime)s.%(msecs).03d {logged_logger_name} %(name)s %(module)s:%(lineno)d]%(end_color)s %(message)s"
```

## Sanitize Spawner.start response
JupyterHub Outpost will use the return value of the start function of the configured SpawnerClass, to tell JupyterHub where the single-user server will be running. For example in the KubeSpawner, the response of KubeSpawner.start() will be something like `http://jupyter-<id>-<user_id>:<port>`. The JupyterHub OutpostSpawner will take this information and create a ssh port-forwarding process with the option `-L 0.0.0.0:<local_jhub_port>:jupyter-<id>-<user_id>:<port>`. Afterwards, JupyterHub will look for the newly created single-user server at `http://localhost:<local_jhub_port>`. If the response of the start function of the configured SpawnerClass in the JupyterHub Outpost service will not be correct, OutpostSpawner and Outpost can not work together properly. To ensure nearly all Spawners can be used anyway, you can override the response send to the OutpostSpawner.

```
# This may be a coroutine
def sanitize_start_response(spawner, original_response):
  # ... determine the correct location for the new single-user server
  return "<...>"

c.JupyterHubOutpost.sanitize_start_response = sanitize_start_response
```

```{admonition} Note
If you don't know where your single-user server will be running in the end, you have to return an empty string. JupyterHub OutpostSpawner won't create a ssh port-forwarding process. The start process of the single-user server has to send a POST request to the `$JUPYTERHUB_SETUPTUNNEL_URL` url. Have a look at the API Endpoints of the OutpostSpawner for more information.
```

## Disable JupyterHub configuration overwrite
By default JupyterHubs can overwrite the JupyterHub Outpost configuration with the `custom_misc` function. As an administrator of the JupyterHub Outpost service, you can prevent this.  

```
async def allow_override(jupyterhub_name, misc):
    if jupyterhub_name == "trustedhub":
        return True
    if list(misc.keys()) != ["image"]:
        return False
    return misc.get("image", "None") in ["allowed_image1", "allowed_image2"]

c.JupyterHubOutpost.allow_override = allow_override
```

The above example leads to the following behaviour:  
 - JupyterHub with credential username "trustedhub" can overwrite anything. 
 - If a JupyterHub (other than trustedhub) tries to overwrite anything except the `image` key, it will not be allowed.
 - The given image must be `allowed_image1` or `allowed_image2`.

```{admonition} Note
If `custom_misc` in the POST request is empty, the `allow_override` function will not be called.  
If `allow_override` returns False, the JupyterLab will not be started. An error message will be returned to the JupyterHub OutpostSpawner.
```


## Recreate ssh tunnels at startup
If your JupyterHub Outpost is used as ssh node in the JupyterHub OutpostSpawner, all port-forwarding processes for this JupyterHub Outpost have to be recreated, if the JupyterHub Outpost service was restarted. Existing `ssh` port-forwarding process will fail after a few seconds and the user's single-user server would be unreachable.  

By default tunnels will be recreated at JupyterHub Outpost restarts. You can disable this behaviour with the `ssh_recreate_at_start` key.  

```
async def restart_tunnels(wrapper, jupyterhub_credential):
    if jupyterhub_credential == "local_jupyterhub":
        return False
    return True

c.JupyterHubOutpost.ssh_recreate_at_start = restart_tunnels
# c.JupyterHubOutpost.ssh_recreate_at_start = False
```


```{admonition} Note
JupyterHub Outpost will use the stored JupyterHub API token to recreate the port-forwarding process. If the API token is no longer valid, this will fail. The single-user server would then be unreachable and must be restarted by the user.
```
